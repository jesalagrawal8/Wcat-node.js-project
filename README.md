# Wcat ðŸš€  

`wcat` is a Node.js-based clone of the Linux `cat` command.  
It allows you to read, display, and manipulate the contents of files directly from the terminal.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Display the contents of one or more files.  
- Concatenate multiple files and show them in order.  
- Remove large line breaks (`-s` option).  
- Add line numbers (`-n` for all lines, `-b` for non-empty lines).  
- Redirect output to another file (`>` to overwrite, `>>` to append).  
- Support for **Shebang (`#!`)** so it can be used as a **global CLI tool**.
